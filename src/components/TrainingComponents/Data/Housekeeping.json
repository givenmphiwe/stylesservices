    "TopDown":[
        "Cleaning from the top down is common sense. Dust and dirt fall downward. Therefore start by cleaning any cobwebs around the top of the walls and light fittings. Then work downward systematically. Finish off by mopping or vacuuming the floor. Working your way around the room, and out the door."
    ],
    "DailyBins":[
        "Waste bins in all rooms should be emptied at least once a day. Rubbish left to fester will give off odors. Attracting insects and other pests. Frequent emptying of bins is especially important in hot weather. When the rate of decomposition quickens significantly.",
        "Kitchen bins should be taken out each night once the kitchen has been cleaned down after dinner. Every room should always look immaculate and smell great."
    ],
    "Thoroughly":[
        "Bathrooms and kitchens are where bacteria thrives the most, so they should always be thoroughly cleaned. Upset stomachs and other nasty diseases are spread through poor sanitation, so keeping these areas clean is paramount.",
        "All principals and guests are to be avoided at all costs. A surprise visit from a public health official, or a string of sick guests, could cause the hotel to be closed down temporarily or even permanently."
    ],
    "Checklist":[
        "Every room should have a checklist itemizing all the jobs required and how often they should be done. Keeping track of completed tasks and they were done will ensure you work efficiently and effectively. There’s no point wasting time pulling out beds if they are only due to be done once a week but were done only the day before. The checklist will also ensure that duties are not missed."
    ],
    "Wonders":[
        "Keeping on top of grease and grime in high traffic areas will ensure that areas stay sparkling and in their original condition. Heavy staining is very hard to remove, and time consuming, so regular cleaning is more efficient and ensures things always look their best."
    ],
    "Discreet":[
        "Housekeepers will see and hear all sorts of things whilst going about their duties. Whether in a principal’s home or a guest’s room, this is their private space, so your discretion is key. Ensure everyone knows who they should approach with any concerns regarding security."
    ],
    "Perspective":[
        "Everywhere should be clean and tidy. What you see when you stand in the middle of the room may not be the same as when your guest or principal lies in the bath or in bed. Double check what they can see and make sure there’s nothing visible that shouldn’t be seen."
